<p>
    Being in this class is something that excites me and I hope to be able to learn another programming language, but more than that I
    hope to learn how to learn and how to be productive in the assignments that I am given. I do not know what languages I will be learning
    in my job, but I do know that learning how to be effective and in what ways I learn best will help me throughout my career.
